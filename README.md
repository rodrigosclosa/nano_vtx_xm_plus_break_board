# Whoop Breaking Board for Eachine Nano VTX and FRSky XM+ Receiver (also can be used with FlySky FS-A8s)

This was made on Eagle to use with Whoops or Toothpicks (25.5x25.5mm hole pattern).
You can use the pinout for others Nano VTX and other receivers too like the FlySky FS-A8S.

Put a good Thermal Adhesive Tape between VTX and the coper exposed to get a good heat dissipation.

There is two versions: A Single board and a 2x2 Panelized PCB to order many.

Download the corresponding .zip file and order it at www.jlcpcb.com. The panelized version is also recognized by JLCPCB and you can order 5 PCB's x 4 each = 20 PCB's for only U$ 5.00 :D
